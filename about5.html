      <h2>
      Have you had a loved one unexpectedly become disabled? I did.
      </h2>
    
     <p>
       There were so many things that I didn’t know or understand.
     </p>
    
     <p>
       In September, 2019, my mom and dad suffered strokes on the same day.<br/>  I discovered that I was completely 
      <strong>unprepared </strong>for this event.
      </p>
    
    <p>
    I was very close to my parents.  My dad came home from the hospital and died a month later. My mom was still in the hospital.  
    As a result of the stroke, my mom went from being a <i>mobile</i>, <b>lively</b> individual to a <i>paralyzed</i>, <b>bedridden</b> individual.  
    She lost her husband of 60 years and her ability to care for herself.
    </p> 
    
     <p>
       I hope that by telling our story, it will help you through the <em>challenges</em> you might experience as a person who has been suddenly thrown 
       into a similar life-changing event.
    </p>
