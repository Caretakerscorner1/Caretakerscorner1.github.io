<h1>Elizabeth Schilling</h1>
    <p><h3>Have you had a loved one unexpectedly become disabled? </h3> <b>I did.</b> <i></i>There were so many things that I didn’t know 
        or understand.</h3></i>
    <br>In September, 2019, my mom and dad suffered strokes on the same day.<br/>  I discovered that I was completely 
    <strong>unprepared</strong>for this event.
    I was very close to my parents.  My dad came home from the hospital and died a month later. My mom was still in the hospital.  
    As a result of the stroke, my mom went from being a mobile, lively individual to a paralyzed, bedridden individual.  
    She lost her husband of 60 years and her ability to care for herself.  I hope by telling our story, it will help you 
    through the challenges you might experience as a person who has been suddenly thrown into a similar life-changing event.</p>
