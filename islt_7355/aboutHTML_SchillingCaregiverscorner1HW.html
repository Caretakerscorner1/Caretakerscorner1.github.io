<h1>Elizabeth Schilling</h1>
    <p><h3>Have you had a loved one unexpectedly become disabled?</h3> <em><b>I did.</em></b> There were so many things that I didn’t know 
        or understand.<br>In September, 2019, my mom and dad suffered strokes on the same day.<br/>  I discovered that I was completely 
    <strong>unprepared </strong>for this event.
    I was very close to my parents.  My dad came home from the hospital and died a month later. My mom was still in the hospital.  
    As a result of the stroke, my mom went from being a <i>mobile</i>, <b>lively</b> individual to a <i>paralyzed</i>, <b>bedridden</b> individual.  
    She lost her husband of 60 years and her ability to care for herself.  I hope by telling our story, it will help you 
    through the <em>challenges</em> you might experience as a person who has been suddenly thrown into a similar life-changing event.</p>
