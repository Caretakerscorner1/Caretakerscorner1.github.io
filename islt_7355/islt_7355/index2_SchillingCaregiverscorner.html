    <h1 class="test">Hello and Welcome to Caretakers Corner</h1>

    <p><h3>Have you had a loved one unexpectedly become disabled?</h3> <b> I did.</b> My name is 
    Elizabeth Schilling and I hope that by sharing my story, it will help you or a loved one going 
    through a similar experience. There were so many things that I did not know or understand.</p>

    <p> In September, 2019, my mom and dad suffered strokes on the same day.I discovered that I was 
        completely unprepared for this event. I was very close to my parents.  My dad 
        came home from the hospital and died a month later. My mom was still in the hospital at the 
        time of his death.</p>

    <p>As a result of the stroke, my mom went from being a mobile, lively individual 
        to a paralyzed, bedridden individual. She lost her husband of 60 years and her 
        ability to care for herself. I want to share some information with you that I learned in 
        going through this journey. Hopefully, it will help you through the challenges you might 
        experience as a person who has been suddenly thrown into a similar life-changing event.</p>
