     Hi! My name is Elizabeth Schilling. I unexpectedly became a caregiver for my mom after she and my dad both had strokes on the same day in 2019.  
     My dad left the hospital and passed away at home. My mom left the hospital for an hour to attend his funeral. The stroke left my mom with left-side paralysis 
     so she cannot stand, walk, or use the left side of her body.  

     I hope that by developing this website, it will help others by providing resources and a sense of community.  My web application or development experience is 
     minimal. I hope that by taking this course, I will be able to develop the skills to create a place where people who are struggling may be able to find answers 
     and comfort.
     
     My favorite hobby is playing with my pets. I also love spending time with my mom and family.
