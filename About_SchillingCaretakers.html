    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I am a person who went from being a loving daughter of an independent parent to becoming the
        loving caretaker of a paralyzed dependent elderly parent.  Although, I have a
        law degree, a master's degree in public health and have taken a lot of courses in many subjects,
        I felt utterly unprepared for this new role.</p>

    <nav></nav>

    <p> In September, 2019, my mom and dad suffered strokes on the same day. I discovered that I was 
        completely unprepared for this event. I want to share some information with you that I discovered
        going through this new life experience. I hope that my life experience will give you some
        insights on your journey.  Please take comfort in knowing that you are not alone.</p>
